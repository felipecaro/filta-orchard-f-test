# React + Vite + Tailwind

Filta/Orchard test

I choose the stack React/Vite/Tailwind for the test.

- React for framework (comunity support), 
- Vite for compiling, because is faster that webpack (Out-of-the-box speed and performance, especially in development), 
- Tailwind for css (utility-first approach)

# Installation

Prerequisites

clone the repository and enter the folder locally
